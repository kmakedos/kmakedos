My name is Kostas Makedos. 
I was born and raised in a small suburb of Athens. 
All of my friends and family were working class people.

Studied Physics with a love for Astronomy. 
Never managed to do that professionally so it remained my dearest hobby.

I love Computer Systems and I work as a Software Engineer for the past 20+ years. 
Ah, and I have a MSc in Informational Systems too.

What do I love to do?
- Solving complex problems
- Programming
- Photography
- Astronomy
- My Guitar(s)
- Running
